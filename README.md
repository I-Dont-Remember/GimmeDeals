# Madtown Deals site
Project to collect the regular deals in Madison, WI in one place rather than 
scattered on websites and chalkboards around the city.  

## Structure
Website is currently served from the free tier of Netlify.  It is set to automatically build 
from both the master and the develop branch.  We are using Preact to have a small but still
nice looking website.

## Development
First one must have nvm & Node configured on their machine.  Then install the preact cli `npm i -g preact-cli`.
